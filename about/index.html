   <p>
    Thao Uyen Chau is a digital media artist. She chooses to pursue the digital medium because she wants to be part of the upcoming era,
    where the digital realm is expected to operate simultaneously with reality. The convergence of the virtual world and the real world
    provides many opportunities to create and explore art in new and profound directions.
    <br>
    Thao blends reality into the virtual world by depicting stories and events of real life in her digital artworks. The digital world
    allows her to turn everyday objects and normal experiences into dynamic expressions and scenes using distinctive perspectives, bright
    colors, and vibrant patterns. While the real world restricts artistic imagination because of the limitations in engineering or physics,
    the virtual world bends reality into something surreal. Thaoâ€™s artworks take advantage of digital media to create elements of surrealism
    to enhance and elevate the normal into abnormal and remind us that surrealism of the digital world is inspired and originated from the
    real world. In addition to working in digital media, Thao has created works in print and sculpture.

   <br>
    Thao is a BFA graduate in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. Her works were chosen to display at San Jose State University, and one of her woodcut prints won the Presidents Art Award at Diablo Valley College and was bought by the school to display for their permanent art collection. Before committing her practice to art, specifically digital media art, Thao was a self-taught graphic designer for a few years when she lived in Vietnam. She was employed as a graphic designer at Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app, and Tiki, a pioneer e-commerce company in Vietnam. After relocating to the United States, Thao enhanced her focus to also include 3D modeling and digital drawing.
