        Hi, my name is Thao. I am a digital media artist and graphic designer.
      <br>
      <br>
        &#128161; I often look at things from a different perspective to discover their hidden sides to depict fresh stories in my works.
        I choose the digital medium for my practice because it is exciting to be a part of a creative crew who is building and
        improving the digital world. Digital tools allow me to create art to entertain people or create products that can benefit them.
        It really gives me the ability to balance between artistic and realistic characteristics.
      <br>
      <br>
        &#127775; I graduated with a BFA degree in Digital Media Art at San Jose State University. After a few years working as a graphic designer, 
        being employed at Grab, Southeast Asia's leading super app, and Tiki.vn, a pioneer e-commerce company in Vietnam, I decided to go 
        back to school to expand my knowledge and strengthen my skills in digital media creation to learn about concept, 3D modeling, website, 
        and virtual environment development.
      <br>
      <br>
        My works were chosen to be displayed at San Jose State University, and one of my works has won the Presidents Art Award at Diablo Valley College 
        and was bought by the school to display in their permanent art collection. 
      <br>
      <br>
        &#128421; I enjoy the creation process which includes brainstorming for concepts, research, sketch, and finally execution and implementation through software.
      <br>
      <br>
        &#129473; I love playing board games with family and friends and doing woodblock printing when I have a lot of free time. You can check out some of my prints
