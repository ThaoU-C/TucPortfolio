      <h3> <i>Giant Yellow Head,</i> Paper Collage, 2020</h3>
   </div>
   <p>Giant Yellow Head is an extrapolated and extruded three-dimensional installation of a collage of an unusually colorful room with unusual objects that are placed where they don’t belong. Collages originated as a form of anti-aestheticism in the early 20th Century and were not perceived and accepted as art. Similarly, when digital installation art first appeared, it was controversial and was rejected as real art. While new art forms and media are rejected because they are anti-establishment or not physically real, art as abstraction is not celebrated when produced by minorities. Only art as identity is stereotypically displayed and fetishized. Giant Yellow Head is an abstract installation. It does not belong. It simply exists to celebrate, elevate, and effervesce the non-standard and challenge the idea of acceptance.</p>

   <p>The collage was turned into a physical installation at the Hammer Theater. The color of the room changed from green to red to bring different vibes to the space. Images from the gallery above show the audience interacting with the installation.</p>
