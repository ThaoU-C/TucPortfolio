   <h3> Mining Spaceship, 2023</h3> <br>
   <br>
   <p>This mining spaceship model was inspired by the shape of a giant squid. While brainstorming for the project,
    I browsed an article about a rare giant squid that was found dead on a beach in South Africa. I thought that the
    functionality of a squidâ€™s body like its flexible tentacles and streamlined torpedo shape would translate well to
    an environment in space that requires mobility and precise control. <br>
    <br>
    This was built from scratch by coming up with the idea, sketching, modeling, texturing the model, and exporting the model to use in different platforms.
