    <p> Visual design for <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/" target="_blank"><b>Grab</b></a><br>
    <br>
    At Grab, I was an in-house visual designer. I worked under an art director and communicated directly with the Marketing and Product teams to design digital and print graphic assets for promotional campaigns and in-house use.
    The goal of the designs was to create cheerful but concise graphic works that catch customers' attention.
    It was important to follow company brand guidelines to create fun and energetic works that reflect company culture and was cohesive with the overall branding and messaging.
    <br>
    <br>
    Finalized designs were scaled to various sizes to fit across multiple social media and advertising platforms.
    <br>
    <br>
    Tools: Illustrator, Photoshop, and After Effects
