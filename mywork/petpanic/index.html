    <h4>Brief</h4>
    Through this game, our team seeks to bring attention to the hardship of sheltered animals.
    Cats and dogs that are not adopted quickly would often be euthanized. Older animals, black cats, and pit bulls
    usually have the lowest adoption rates. The game mechanic reflects the challenges these animals face by making
    it more difficult to jump or decreasing the timing required to accomplish tasks. The character designs are adorable
    and colorful to evoke a feeling of lightheartedness and fun to sharply contrast with the harsh reality confronting sheltered animals. <br>

   <br>
   <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
   <p> My partner and I brainstormed together to come up with ideas, themes, and types of game we want to create. We were both inspired by Super Mario
   and love our pets. Therefore, we decided to create a 2D platformer game with a pet theme but also have an impactful message.</p>
   <h4>Analysis</h4>
   <p>I did some research to find our target audience. According to a Petfood Industry's survey, Millenials and Gen Z are the groups that are most likely to adopt pets.
   Therefore, I decided that our target audience will be young professionals who are active, single, and value their emotional well-being. 
   This group is more likely to adopt pets to help reduce their stress level and spend time with their animal companions.<br>
   After selecting the target audience, the color scheme and art style were decided.

    <h4>Testing</h4>
    <p>We conducted three playtests with about 30 players, and I was the investigator who administered the playtests.<br>
      <li>Alpha test:</li> Family members, close friends, and people in school were asked to playtest the game and fill out a survey regarding their experience with the game. 
      <br>
      <br>
      We received positive feedback about the game theme and graphics. Most players found the game to be fun. There were also suggestions on improving the graphic resolution
      and jumping mechanic, which was too strong. Also, the first level was too difficult to pass which led to frustration among some players.
      <br>
      We then implemented these suggestions in our later designs.
      <br>
      <br>
      <li>Second playtest:</li>
      Based on the feedback, timerâ€™s size and location were adjusted to make it more visible.
      Time length was increased from 25 to 35 seconds to complete the first level. The graphic resolution was also changed to be a higher quality.<br>
      <br>
      <li>Beta Test:</li>

      Three levels were completed on time, but there are still some minor bugs that we wish we had more time to fix.<br>

      <h4>Reflections</h4>
      <p> Through this project, I learned about the process of creating a game from scratch and how to collaborate with developers to 
        keep track of progress to deliver the game on time. I also enjoy interacting with players, observing their reactions to my game, and
        receiving their feedback.
