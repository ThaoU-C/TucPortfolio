    Sharepoint web design for<a href="https://www.nozominetworks.com/" target="_blank"> <b> Nozomi Networks</b></a> <br>
      <br>
      My role was to redesign and rebuild company internal websites. Working directly with HR leadership, I collected ideas and requirements
      to create designs and implement them in SharePoint.
      The goal of the project was to create Sharepoint sites
      that contain useful information and resources for employees. The web design must align with company brand guidelines
      and is easy to navigate and maintain.
      <br>
      <br>
      The sites received excited and positive feedback once completed with traffic drastically increasing. Many other department leadership was also interested and driven in using Sharepoint as their information channel. <br>
      <br>
      Tools: Figma and Photoshop

    Graphic design for <a href="https://www.grab.com/sg/" target="_blank"><b>Grab</b></a><br>
    <br>
    At Grab, I was an in-house graphic designer. I worked under an art director and communicated directly with Marketing and the Product team to design digital and print graphic assets for promotional campaigns and in-house use.
    The goal of the designs is to create cheerful but concise graphic works that catch customers' attention.
    It is important to follow company brand guidelines to create fun and energetic works that reflect company culture and is cohesive with the overall branding and messaging. Finalized designs are resized to fit across multiple social media platforms.
