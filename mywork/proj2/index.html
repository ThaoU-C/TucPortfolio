      <h3> <i>Giant Yellow Head,</i> Paper Collage, 2020</h3>
   </div>
   <p>I love working with patterns, colors, and shapes. This artwork is created to demonstrate the interaction of vivid colors,
      unique shapes, and strange patterns in a surreal composition. The original artwork is a paper cutout and composed into
      a digital collage. The Audacity is used to glitch the collage to create chaotic
      ​distortion and decomposition of the paper cutouts' original patterns and forms.</p>
