   <h3> Sacred Forest, 3D Environment, 2023 </h3> <br>
   <br>
   <p>
    Sacred Forest depicts a cemetery environment at night. The player will wander around the cemetery as
    a kid with a lamp in hand looking for a playground. The lamp will illuminate the environment when the
    player moves, so the player can find a gate to get out of the cemetery and get to the playground.
    The game hopes to bring a spooky feeling to players as they wander in the darkness.
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea for this was based on my experience as a child. I once went to a cemetery
    to play with childhood friends at night and experienced peculiar events. After the trip, I dreamt
    about getting lost in a cemetery for a whole month. For every night that month, I saw myself being stuck in the
    dark cemetery, running and screaming, but unable to find the playground or get out of the place.
    <br>

    Sacred Forest was built in Unity and can be <a href="https://thaou-c.itch.io/sacred-forest"> <b>explored in Itch.io. </b></a>
