    Sacred Forest depicts a cemetery environment at night. The player will wander around the cemetery as
    a kid with a lamp in hand looking for a playground. The lamp will illuminate the environment when the
    player moves, so the player can find a portal to leave the cemetery and get to the playground.
    The game hopes to bring a spooky feeling to players as they wander alone in the darkness.
    <br>
    <br>
    The idea for this was based on my experience as a child. I once went to a cemetery
    to play with childhood friends at night and experienced peculiar events. After the trip, I dreamt
    about getting lost in the cemetery for a whole month. For every night of that month, I saw myself being stuck in the
    dark cemetery, running and screaming, but unable to find the playground or get out.
    <br>
    <br>
    The creation process includes brainstorming concept, creating proposal, sketching, developing 3D assets, building the environment in Unity, and publishing it on Itch.io.
    <br>
    <br>
    Most of the assets were modeled in Blender and Maya and then imported into Unity to use for the environment.

    <p> Through this project, I learned about the workflow of creating a 3D environment and overcame many development issues since it was my first time using Unity.
