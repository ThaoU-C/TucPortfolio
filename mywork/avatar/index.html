   <h3> 3D Modeling, 2022</h3>
   <p>This work was created as an NFT from a picture taken when Bi took Helen for a walk. Dog ownership in the US
      carries an attractive aura that speaks beyond just having a pet. Walking a dog through the neighborhood
      enhances the owner's image as friendly, active, responsible, and stable.
      â€‹The artwork was painted in Photoshop to demonstrate the perception of the dog-owner relationship.
